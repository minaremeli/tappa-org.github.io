Dear all, the end of the year 2024 is coming closer! We would like to celebrate the approaching end of this academic year with the second edition of the **Tübingen Pre-NeurIPS Fest**, a poster session followed by a festive get-together. 

If you have a paper accepted to a peer-reviewed ML venue since June, please sign up as a poster presenter! We hope to accommodate up to 40 posters.

Best, 
Cluster of Excellence "Machine Learning" & Tübingen AI Center & ELLIS Institute Tübingen & Tübingen AI PhD and Postdoc Assembly (TAPPA).
