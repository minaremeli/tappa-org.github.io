Dear all,

We are excited to be **restarting the Friday Talks series** and would like to warmly invite you to the first session on 24th of January 2025 at 5pm at the AI Research Building (Maria-von-Lindenstra√üe 6). 

We are currently looking for speakers. If you would like to give a talk, please fill out this [form](https://tinyurl.com/mrx22r8p). There is only a limited number of spots left so better be quick! 

You can find more information on the Friday Talks website [fridaytalks.github.io](https://fridaytalks.github.io) and on [Tuebingen Talks](https://talks.tuebingen.ai).

We look forward to seeing you on 24th of January!

Tim, Zeju, Johannes
