*Looking for new organizers!*
Previously led by Christian Fr√∂hlich, Nina Effenberger and Sebastian Zezulka; Failure Friday edition led by Kibidi Neocosmos.


Friday talks are a bi-weekly format in which two researchers from our community present their latest research (questions) as 10-minute talks, followed by drinks and pretzels. Failure Friday is a special edition of this format (happening roughly every 3-4 months): PIs and Postdocs are invited to talk about their experience with failure in their academic career.

The Friday Talks has been a community favorite attracting many people for scientific and informal networking. Currently, TAPPA is looking for new organizers to continue this tradition! So if this is something you would like to continue, please reach out to us!
