**Failure Friday is back!**
For those who haven't heard: Failure Friday is a special edition of the [Friday Talks](https://fridaytalks.github.io) where we invite speakers to talk about their experiences with failure.
The idea is to normalise the fact that mistakes and failure are a natural part of research, and that’s okay.
We hope that sharing experiences, and simply talking about it, will be a step towards that.

The event is taking place on May 16th, 17:00, in the AI Research Building lecture hall (Maria-von-Lindenstraße 6).
We will host Dr Claire Vernade and Prof Moritz Hardt as speakers.

See you there!
