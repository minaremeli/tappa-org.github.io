Tübingen is world-renowned for its cutting-edge AI research — but do you actually know what our scientists are working on?
At this Science Slam, PhD students and postdocs from the University of Tübingen will take the stage to **present their research in 10-minute talks that are anything but boring**. From self-driving cars and robotics to deep learning, computational neuroscience, and probability theory — this is your chance to discover the world behind the buzzword AI. You get to decide who wins: **your applause determines the best presentation of the night!**

The event is organized by the Tübingen AI PhD and Postdoc Assembly (TAPPA) and supported by the Cluster of Excellence "Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science" and Rhet AI.

- When:  5 June, 7 pm
- Venue: Kupferbau, Hörsaal 22
- Organizers: Tübingen AI PhD and Postdoc Assembly (TAPPA)
- All talks will be in English. Admission is free.
