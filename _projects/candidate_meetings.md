title: "Student-Candidate meetings: Involving PhDs and Postdocs in recruitment"
---

Project led by Mila Gorecki.

As the AI Center representative, Mila was tasked with organizing meetings between faculty candidates and PhD students. TAPPA was central in spreading the word and many of our members participated in those meetings, and our feedback was passed onto the deciding committee. It was empowering to involve PhDs in decision making processes that are of consequence to us all.
