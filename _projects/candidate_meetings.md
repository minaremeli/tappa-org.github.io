title: "Student-Candidate meetings: Involving PhDs and Postdocs in faculty recruitment"
---

Project led by Mila Gorecki.

In previous hiring rounds from the AI Center, Mila organized informal 30-minute meetings between faculty candidates and small groups of PhDs, Postdocs and MSc students. Feedback from these meetings was shared with the search committee. 

Another way for PhD students and Postdocs to get involved in faculty recruitment is to join the search commitee as one of the Mittelbau representatives.
