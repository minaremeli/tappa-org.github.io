title: "Community Building on Campus"

Our ever-growing AI community in Tübingen can only thrive if tight! We organize together, divided in different teams, initiatives to help people connecting with other reaserchers at personal and professional level. It can take form of events, talks, parties or a buddy/support system.


- Seasonal Poster Sessions & Get-Together. Led by Çağatay Yıldız, help always welcome!
- Friday Talk & Beer. *Looking for new organizers!* Previously led by Christian Fröhlich, Nina Effenberger and Sebastian Zezulka
- Failure Friday: Special Edition of Friday Talk, focusing of difficulties and failures faced during one's academic journy. Led by Kibidi Neocosmos
- Buddy System in every graduate school. We all know how hard is to start in a new city (or country!). We think a Buddy System will help finding new friends, getting started in the campus and discovery quickly all the Tübingen know-how.
- Pushing for Ombudspeople in every institution. Trained people in different positions (Admin, Research) and seniority levels offer support in case of problems or conflicts in the workplace.
