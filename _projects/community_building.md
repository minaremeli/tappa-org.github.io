title: "Community Building on Campus"
---

Our AI community in Tübingen thrives on strong connections! We work together in various teams and initiatives to help people connect with other researchers on both personal and professional levels. These efforts take the form of events, talks, parties, or support systems like a buddy program.

Some examples:
- **Seasonal Poster Sessions & Get-Together**: Led by Çağatay Yıldız. help is always welcome!
- **Friday Talk & Beer**: Led by Tim Xiao, Johannes Zenn and Zeju Qiu. More info at [https://fridaytalks.github.io/](https://fridaytalks.github.io/)
- **Failure Friday**: Special Edition of Friday Talk, focusing of difficulties and failures faced during one's academic journey. Led by Kibidi Neocosmos.
- **Buddy System** in every graduate school. Starting in a new city (or country) is tough! A Buddy System can help newcomers find friends, settle into campus life, and quickly learn the Tübingen know-how.
- **Tuebingen AI Center Wiki**: Developed together with the AI Center Administration, led by Auguste Schulz.
