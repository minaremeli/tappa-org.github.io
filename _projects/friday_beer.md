title: "Community building with Friday Beer"
---

Led by Christian Fr√∂hlich, Nina Effenberger and Sebastian Zezulka; Failure Friday edition led by Kibidi Neocosmos.

Every two weeks we had two short talks followed by drinks and pretzels. This was a community favorite attracting many people for scientific and informal networking. Every 3 or 4 months, the Failure Friday edition took place, with 2-3 talks (10 minutes each) by PIs and Postdocs about their experience with failure in their academic career.

Since the organizers are nearing graduation, TAPPA is actively looking for new organizers who can continue this tradition.
