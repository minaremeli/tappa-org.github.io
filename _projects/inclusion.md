title: "Inclusion & Transparency"
---
The rapid growth in the number of AI research labs in TÃ¼bingen underscores the need for a shared platform to address and act on the challenges faced by young researchers. In response, we established the TAPPA initiative to bring together PhD students and Postdocs working in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our primary goal is to shape an inclusive, safe, and welcoming community built collaboratively from the ground up.

Some examples:
- **Student-Candidate Meetings**: Involving PhDs and Postdocs in faculty recruitment. Led by Mila Gorecki. Help is always welcome!
- **Monthly TAPPA Meeting & Social**: A space for all members and interested researchers to gather, discuss challenges, share ideas, and collaborate. Student representatives exchange information and invite interested students and Postdocs to participate in decision-making.
