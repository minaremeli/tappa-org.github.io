title: "Inclusion & Transparency"
---
The rapid growth of AI research labs in TÃ¼bingen has created the need for a platform where young researchers can discuss and tackle their challenges. Our main goal is to build an inclusive, safe, and welcoming community, starting from the ground up. We also want to students and Postdocs to be more aware of and involved in the decision-making process behind what happens in our campus.

Some examples:
- **Student-Candidate Meetings**: Involving PhDs and Postdocs in faculty recruitment. Led by Mila Gorecki. Help is always welcome!
- **Monthly TAPPA Meeting & Social**: A space for all members and interested researchers to gather, discuss challenges, share ideas, and collaborate. Student representatives exchange information and invite interested students and Postdocs to participate in decision-making.
