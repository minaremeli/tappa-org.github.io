title: "Inclusion & Transparency"
---
The recent explosion in the number of AI research labs in TÃ¼bingen necessitates a joint platform to discuss and act on emerging issues of young researchers. To this end, we created the TAPPA initiative: we aim to bring together PhD students and Postdocs doing research in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our main objective is to help shape our community to be inclusive, safe and welcoming from the bottom up.

Some examples:
- Student-Candidate meetings: Involving PhDs and Postdocs in faculty recruitment. Led by Mila Gorecki, help always welcome!
- Monthly TAPPA Meeting & Social: All members and interested researched get together to discuss problems and ideas; student reps exchange information and involve interested students/Postdocs in decision making.
