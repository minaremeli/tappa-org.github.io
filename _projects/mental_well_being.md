We are committed to fostering a supportive environment, helping researchers build a balanced and healthy relationship with the research community on campus. Our members contribute through various initiatives:

Some examples:

- **Mental Health First Aid Training**: Several members have completed this training. Reach out if you're interested in joining!
- **Healthy Minds** (2023/24): Organized by Nina Effenberger and Janne Lappalainen. A monthly series of workshops and talks for academics in AI, concerning mental health.
- Pushing for **Ombudspeople** in every institution: Trained individuals from different positions (Admin, Research) and seniority levels provide support for resolving workplace problems or conflicts.
- **Failure Friday**: Special Edition of Friday Talk, focusing of difficulties and failures faced during one's academic journey. Led by Kibidi Neocosmos.
