We are committed to fostering a supportive environment, helping researchers build a balanced and healthy relationship with the research community on campus. Our members contribute through various initiatives:

Some examples:
- **Mental Health & Well-being Survey on Campus** (2023): Led by Laura Iacovissi and Chris Fr√∂hlich. A new edition is coming soon!
- **Mental Health First Aid Training**: Several members have completed this training. Reach out if you're interested in joining!
- **Mental Health Talks**: Organized by Nina [full name] and Janne [full name]. [Add a brief description of the topics or objectives of these talks.]
- Pushing for **Ombudspeople** in every institution: Trained individuals from different positions (Admin, Research) and seniority levels provide support for resolving workplace problems or conflicts.
- **Failure Friday**: Special Edition of Friday Talk, focusing of difficulties and failures faced during one's academic journy. Led by Kibidi Neocosmos.
