title: "Mental Health & Well-Being"
---

We care about creating a supportive environment, that helps researchers maintain good mental health and a healthy work-life balance. Our members lead different initiatives to support well-being on campus, some through group activities and others by offering people who are dedicated to listening and providing help when needed.

Some examples:
- **Mental Health & Well-being Survey on Campus** (2023): Led by Laura Iacovissi and Chris Fr√∂hlich. A new edition is coming soon!
- **Mental Health First Aid Training**: Several members have completed this training. Reach out if you're interested in joining!
- **Healthy Minds** (2023/24): Organized by Nina Effenberger and Janne Lappalainen. A monthly series of workshops and talks for academics in AI, concerning mental health.
- **Pushing for Ombudspeople** in every institution: Trained individuals from different positions (Admin, Research) and seniority levels provide support for resolving workplace problems or conflicts.
- **Failure Friday**: Special Edition of Friday Talk, focusing of difficulties and failures faced during one's academic journey. Led by Kibidi Neocosmos.
