title: "AI-focused poster sessions & get-together"
---

Project led by Cagatay Yildiz.

Cagatay has been organizing poster sessions two times a year where members of the TÃ¼bingen AI scene can present their newly published work. Active discussions with TAPPA members are shaping future events, making them more appealing to a wider audience  and encouraging the presentation of work that is in the making.
