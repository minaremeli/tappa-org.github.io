title: "Scientific Exchange on Campus"
---

A large community of researchers has a wide range of interests -- it migt be hard to keep up with the recents advances of your office-neighbour. We want to promote scientific exchange in our everyday life. PhD Talks, Talk serieses and Invited speakers are how we want to achieve that.

Some examples:
- Seasonal Poster Sessions & Get-Together. Led by Çağatay Yıldız, help always welcome!
- Friday Talk & Beer. *Looking for new organizers!* Previously led by Christian Fröhlich, Nina Effenberger and Sebastian Zezulka
