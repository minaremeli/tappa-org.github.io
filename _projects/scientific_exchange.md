Our large community of researchers spans a wide range of interests, making it challenging to stay updated on the latest advances—even those of your office neighbor. We aim to promote scientific exchange in our daily lives through initiatives like PhD Talks, talk series, and invited speakers.

Some examples:
- **Seasonal Poster Sessions & Get-Together**: Led by Çağatay Yıldız. help is always welcome!
- **Friday Talk & Beer**: *Looking for new organizers!* Previously led by Christian Fröhlich, Nina Effenberger and Sebastian Zezulka.
