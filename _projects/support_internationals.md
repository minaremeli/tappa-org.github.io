title: "Support and Resources for International Researchers"
---

Building a strong, inclusive community means making sure international researchers feel welcome and supported. We provide tools, connections, and guidance to help newcomers navigate academic life and settle into the Tübingen research community.

Some examples:
- **Tuebingen AI Center Wiki**: Developed together with the AI Center Administration, led by Auguste Schulz.
- **Buddy/Confidant System** in every graduate school. Starting in a new city (or country) is tough! A Buddy System can help newcomers find friends, settle into campus life, and quickly learn the Tübingen know-how.
