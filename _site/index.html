<p>TAPPA is a grassroots initiative to bring together PhD students and Postdocs doing research in AI in Tübingen.
  It was created in a joint initiative by PhDs and Postdocs across institutes and graduate schools and is similar in spirit to a student council.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>To work towards enhancing the PhD and Postdoc experience, we see TAPPA as a platform to</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>join forces to push for common issues<br />
  <span class="faded"><em>e.g. improved onboarding through a joint wiki, collecting arguments for higher salaries</em></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>co-organize events across different institutes or PhD programs<br />
  <span class="faded"><em>e.g. pre-conference poster sessions, alumni talk series</em></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide information flow, in particular also between representatives and their communities<br />
  <span class="faded"><em>e.g. latest developments in grad schools, updates from board meetings</em></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include more people in organization and decision processes, for transparency and community building<br />
  <span class="faded"><em>e.g. involvement in faculty recruiting, pushing for a community-wide support structure</em></span></p>
  </li>
</ul>
