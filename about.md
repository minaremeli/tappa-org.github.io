## What is TAPPA?
TAPPA stands for *Tübingen AI PhD and Postdoc Assembly* and is a grassroots initiative to bring together PhD students and Postdocs doing research in AI in Tübingen. 

TAPPA was created in a joint initiative by PhDs and Postdocs across institutes and graduate schools and is similar in spirit to a student council: **the goal is to enhance the PhD and Postdoc experience within the Tübingen AI ecosystem** by addressing common concerns, organizing events, and more. 

Currently, members come from the University of Tübingen, MPI-IS, the Tübingen AI Center, the Cluster of Excellence, the ELLIS Institue as well as CLS and IMPRS-IS, but it is open to all PhDs and Postdocs in the Tübingen AI environment. So feel invited to come by!

### **Goals**
To work towards <mark style="background-color: #fdf6e3;">enhancing the PhD and Postdoc experience</mark>, we see TAPPA as a platform to
- join forces to push for common issues\
<span style="color: #878c92; font-style: italic">e.g. improved onboarding through a joint wiki, collecting arguments for higher salaries</span>
- co-organize events across different institutes or PhD programs\
<span style="color: #878c92; font-style: italic">e.g. pre-conference poster sessions, alumni talk series</span>
- provide information flow, in particular also between representatives and their communities\
<span style="color: #878c92; font-style: italic">e.g. latest developments in grad schools, updates from board meetings</span>
- include more people in organization and decision processes, for transparency and community building\
<span style="color: #878c92; font-style: italic">e.g. involvement in faculty recruiting, pushing for a community-wide support structure</span>

### **Why should you join TAPPA?**
TAPPA is open to all PhDs and Postdocs in Tübingen doing research in AI! If you want to contribute to your community and get more involved in improving it, TAPPA is a great way to get to meet other motivated people, find collaborators and helpers and gain more insights into ongoing decision processes at the different institutes or grad schools. Come by our monthly meetings! We're looking forward to seeing you!
