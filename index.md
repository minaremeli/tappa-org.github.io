TAPPA is a grassroots initiative to bring together PhD students and Postdocs doing research in AI in Tübingen.
It is similar in spirit to a student council: the goal is to **enhance the PhD and Postdoc experience** within the Tübingen AI ecosystem by addressing common concerns, organizing events, and more.
