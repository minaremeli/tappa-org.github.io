## About us
TAPPA is a grassroots initiative to bring together PhD students and Postdocs doing research in AI in Tübingen.
It is similar in spirit to a student council: the goal is to enhance the PhD and Postdoc experience within the Tübingen AI ecosystem by addressing common concerns, organizing events, and more.


#### Goals
- join forces to push for common issues\
<span style="color: gray;">*e.g. improved onboarding through a joint wiki, collecting arguments for higher salaries*</span>
- co-organize events across different institutes or PhD programs\
<span style="color: gray;">*e.g. pre-conference poster sessions, alumni talk series*</span>
- provide information flow, in particular also between representatives and their communities\
<span style="color: gray;">*e.g. latest developments in grad schools, updates from board meetings*</span>
- include more people in organization and decision processes, for transparency and community building\
<span style="color: gray;">*e.g. involvement in faculty recruiting, pushing for a community-wide support structure*</span>

## Why should you join?
TAPPA is open to all PhDs and Postdocs in Tübingen doing research in AI!
If you want to contribute to your community and get more involved in improving it,
TAPPA is a great way to get to meet other motivated people, find collaborators and
helpers and gain more insights into ongoing decision processes at the different
institutes or grad schools.
